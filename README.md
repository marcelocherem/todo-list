The To-Do List Project is a web-based application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.
Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks using the input field and the "Add" button.

Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button (X).
Reorder Tasks: Users can move tasks up or down the list using the arrow buttons.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application.
CSS: Used for styling the application, including responsive design and visual effects.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for adding, deleting, completing, and reordering tasks.
DOM Manipulation: Utilized to dynamically update the task list based on user interactions.
